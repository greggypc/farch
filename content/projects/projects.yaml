  desc: "The seed for the Elephant House came in the form of a particular material; corrugated fiber cement panels. This material has been in use for some time in Europe, primarily as roofing material for large industrial buildings. There is no other way to describe the appearance and texture of the material than to compare it to the hide of an elephant. <br /><br /> The form of the house is simple and monolithic, portrayed as if in the midst of an archaeological dig, propped up on wooden supports as the interior, rendered in red handmade brick, is revealed through the process of subtraction. The deck between the house and garage creates an open air plaza, upon which the ever-present breeze can be enjoyed."

  desc: "Court Houses are the result of our desire to increase density within the urban core of Austin. Instead of building one single family residence on a city lot, we built two.<br /><br />The lot is on a corner, which provided separate points of access. The surrounding neighborhood context is a mixture of residential projects and city and private development infrastructure. This infrastructure, located across each street forming the corner, informed a courtyard design for the houses as a way to mitigate their presence and provide a private refuge.<br /><br />Formally each house is an L, opposing one another to create a perimeter boundary surrounding an internal courtyard. The courtyard is bisected by a mixed red handmade brick wall as it weaves through the property, providing both physical and visual separation between each house, as well as a contrast to the smooth steel troweled white stucco used to clad the houses.<br /><br />The first floors are separated, and these opposing separations provide passage into the courtyard and subsequent entry for each house. The second floors are joined above these exterior passages due to zoning restrictions, however distinct separation is achieved through framing and ceiling heights."
